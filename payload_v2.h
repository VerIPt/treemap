/*
 *  Payload serves for testing correct use of constructors and destructors when
 *  designing you own memory-managing classes.
 * 
 *  - counts how often a constructor was called
 *  - counts how often a destructor was called
 *  - assigns sequential ID to each Payload object to check when it was constructed
 *  - checks if you access Payload object before construction (if ID is in wrong range)
 *  - marks memory of destructed Payload object with a special ID
 *  - checks if you access Payload object after destruction
 *
